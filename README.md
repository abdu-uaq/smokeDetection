# Function: Detecting Smoke in Video



## I. Making Data Sets

### 1. The original training data and test data are stored in the dataSet file with the size of 32*24, which is used to generate the TXT file. The train and test files under the dataSet file are generated by merging the subfiles under the train and test files under the dataSet file. The training data set and the test data set are stored separately, and the image_txt file is generated by calling the class function in the makeData.py file. The ecords file is stored under the tfrecords file


## II. Training

### 1. forward.py: Forward Operating Network (VGG), forward.py: Reverse optimization and save the trained model to the Model file

## III. Testing and Model Application

### 1. App.py test single picture under app file, handleVideo.py file process video, and apply the trained model to video analysis; the accuracy rate of smoke recognition is 98%.
